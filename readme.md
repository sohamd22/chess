# Chess (AI Practice Project)
Run controller.py to run the game.

Keep in mind:
- This version does not have all the features of modern chess, for example castling and en-passant
- The bot can be slow but still fun to play with, you can increase the speed by reducing the DEPTH variable in chessBoard.py

This is a very quick practice project that I've made to implement a real-world case of an AI search algorithm after learning about it in the Harvard CS50 course: https://cs50.harvard.edu/ai/2024/weeks/0/. It uses the minimax algorithm with a small bit of optimization via alpha-beta pruning and caching.
