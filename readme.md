# Chess (AI Practice Project)
Run controller.py to run the game.

Keep in mind:
- This version does not have all the features of modern chess, for example castling and en-passant
- The bot isn't accurate and very slow but still fun to play with, you can increase the speed by reducing the DEPTH variable in chessBoard.py

The code is pretty unoptimized and extremely rushed as this is a quick practice project that I've made to implement a real-world case of an AI search algorithm after learning about it in the Harvard CS50 course: https://cs50.harvard.edu/ai/2024/weeks/0/. It uses the minimax algorithm with a small bit of optimization via alpha-beta pruning and caching.

Might optimize the game in the future but as of now it is just a practice project.
